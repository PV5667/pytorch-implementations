What are anchor boxes and how are they used in the training of the network? 

A lot of the code for the generation of anchor boxes and the handling of anchor boxes in this network was inspired from the PyTorch implementations in the open source book Dive into Deep Learning. 

Every line of these functions was methodically studied and appropriate comments were added when I found something of interest or came upon something previously unknown.

Attached is the citation for the book:
